# SudokuSolver
Implementation in various languages with various methods.

This project was chosen entirely arbitrarily and in the process of trying to find plaintext sudoku puzzles I discovered that Euler 96 is sudoku based. 

Currently I've only got a naive implementation in Python, it can solve about 40% of puzzles in under 0.2 seconds, but is entirely unable to solve the rest. ~~Good enough.~~

If for whatever reason you want a difficult-to-use, second-rate sudoku solver just run the python script and change the plaintext in the puzzles.txt file.
